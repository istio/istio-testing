Prow Bazel Image
----------------

This image is suitable for projects that use bazel to build and test code. The image comes with bazel, go, docker, and gcloud utilities.

### Building Image

Use `make image` to build the docker image. Run `make push` to send it to the istio-testing gcr registry.

### Running Image Locally

Use `./run.sh` to start the docker image locally.

### Dependency on `bootstrap.py`

This `bootstrap.py` file is copied here so that we have a local copy. It is copied from the [k8s test-infra version](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/jenkins).

We modify bootstrap.py in two ways:

1. It looks for job scripts in `<source-repo>/jobs/<script>.sh` rather than in the kubernetes `test-infra/jobs/<script>.sh`.
2. It does _not_ set up the "magic" environment.

Long term, if we use `bootstrap.py`, it would be prudent to push these changes upstream, perhaps as flags to further configure bootstrap.py.

Our dependency on this script is because it appropariately writes test job results to a GCS bucket in such a way that gubernator (a basic UI k8s test-infra run to view job results) understands. The specification of this structure is inherent in bootstrap.py and the gubernator front-end.
